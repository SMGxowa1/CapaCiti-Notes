1. Cloud Computing Fundamentals
# Understanding Cloud Concepts
## Cloud Components and Clients
- there are three main components in a cloud service solution. 
- first being client platform, second is data center and third is the network conncetion.
- data center - hosts cloud services
- client - means of access to cloud services and client devices.
- path between cloud services and devices.
- cloud infrastructure can be managed internally by a single organization or its own or managed by a CSP, these can be combined into a hybrid solution.
- public cloud - a CSP owns cloud deployment and allocates resources to external, unaffiliated customers. They share the cloud resources.
- private cloud - services are provided to only a single organization.
- hybrid cloud - there is a combination of two or more private, public or community deployments.
- multicloud - a variety of public cloud services to support different developer and business units.

## Cloud Computing Elements: Resource Pools/Cloud Models and Services
- databases, identity management, and email servers. These software services are also available in cloud environments, and they are typically constructed as a shared, multi-tenant service. Multi-tenancy is a computing architecture that allows customers to share computing resources in the cloud. Although customers are sharing resources, their individual configurations and data are isolated.

## Cloud Delivery Models
- simplest explanations of cloud services is the idea of offloading responsibility
- 3 different cloud service models representing computing environment services.
- Infrastructure as Service(IaaS) - the hardware infrustructure provided to the consumer, consumer responsible for all layers above hardware. CSP manages hardware, consumer installs and manages operating system.
- Platform as a Service(PaaS) - service is provided by the CSP. Up to consuemr to populate structure, manage day-to-day basis and assume responsibility. 
- Software as a Service(SaaS) - consumer provided with direct use of software. Responsibility for hardware where software runs.
