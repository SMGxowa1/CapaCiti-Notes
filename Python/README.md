## Introduction to Python
1. Introduction 
### How Computers Work
- Computer memory is a grid where it stores files and data.
- A file with a file name is represented in the computer's directory.
- Along with file name is info stored about the file e.g. size.
- Access to contents of file, computer follows a pointer, an address representing location of file contents in memory.
- Writing and running a program is interaction with the memory.
- Programs generate bits of data (variables)- mini files.
- When assigning variable of the same data type in an array, they both point to the same location.
- This is working with the pc memory, inputting, retrieving and manipulating data. 

### Zen of Python
- Python is elegant fitting in modern era; e.g. syntax used to call one function is likely to be similar to that used to call a similar function.
- Python's true potential recognized in situations with complexities.
- Python's hidden mission statement "import this", drives this point home.
