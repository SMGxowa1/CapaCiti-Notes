# JavaScript Notes

## What is JavaScript?
-A versatile programming language commonly used for enhancing web apps.
-client side scrpting language, runs on browser.

## History of JavaScript
-created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, originally Livescript.
-also used in mobile, game and server side development.

## JavaScript Features
-Easy to learn: simple syntax, similar to C++ and Java
-Interactivity: able to create interactive elements such as forms, buttons etc. responding to users actions. Also enable dynamic content update.
-Cross-platform Compatibility: supported by all modern browsers. Code written once and seamless on different devices.
-Object-Oriented: concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation are supported. This allows reusable code, more efffecient and maintanable.
-Extensibility: extended through libraries and frameworks, providing additional functionalities.

## JavaScript in Action
1. Client-side Web Development
-primarily used for client-side programming, responsible for interactivity and dynamic content.
-handles form validations, perform calculations, manipulate HTML elements etc.

2. Server-side Development
-able to develop complete web apps using server side, enabling more streamlined and efficient development workflows.

3. Mobile App Development
-react nativ and ionic allow developers to use JavaScript to build IOS and Android apps.
-provides a cost-effective and effecient way to create cross-platform apps.

4. Game Development
-JavaScript along HTML5 and CSS3 has changed web-based gaming.
-game engines like Phaser and Pixi.js enabe devs to create sophisticated games played on the browser without plugins.

## Variables and Data Types

### Introduction
-variables are used to store data values. Can be different types: numbers, strings, booleans etc.
-foundation of JavaScript programming 

### Variables
-it is like a container holding a value.
-created using var, let and const keyword followed by a name and assignment operator (=).
-name of variable should be meaningful and follow rules and conventions.

### Data Types
-data types define the nature of values stored in variables
1. Number
-number data type represents numeric values (integer or floating-point number)

2. String
-string data type represents sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

3. Boolean
-represents a logical value, either true or false. Used in conditional statments and comparisons.

4. Undefined
-undefined data type is assigned to variables declared but not initialized with a value.

5. Null
-null data type represents intentional absence of any objevt value. Used to indicate a variable has no value.

6. Object
-object data type represents a collection of key-value pairs. Can contain properties and methods acessed by dot notation.

7. Array
-represents a collection of elements ecnlosed in square brackets. Eahc element in array assigned a numeric index starting form 0.

8. Symbol
-symbols are a new primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 2015. Unique and immutable values used as property keys in objects.

## Control Flow and Loops
### Introduction
-control flow refers to the order which statements are executed. 
-allows us to determine flow of execusion based on conditions
-loops are structures allowing us to repeat a block of code multiple times, until a condition is met.

### Conditional Statements
-allows us to execute diff blocks of code on certain conditions.
-there are three types: if, else if and else.
-if statement: evaluates condition and executes block of code only if condition is true.
-else if statement: allows us to eveluate multiple conditions, one after another, until a condition is true.
-else statement: an optional statment and provides default code block to be executed if non of conditions are met.

### Comparison Operators
-used to compare two values and return a boolean result.
-commonly used within conditional statements evaluating conditions.
-e.g. =; !=; <; >; <=; >= etc.

### Logical Operators
-used to combine multiple conditions and evaluate as a single condition.
-JavaScript provides 3: && (And); ||(Or) and ! (Not)

### Loops
-allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly until condition is no longer true.
-e.g. For Loop; While loop and Do-while loop
-for loop: most common, consisits of 3 parts = initialization, condition and increment/decrement.
-while loop: condition evaluated at the beginning of each iteration and if true, code is executed.
-do-while loop: condition evaluated at end of each iteration. Code block is always executed at least once regardless of condition.

### Breaking and Continuing 
-some situations you need to exit a loop prematurely, JavaScript provides the breal and continue statements.
-break statement used to terminate loop immediately and resume program executiom from next statment after loop.
-continue statment used to skip current iteration and move to next iteration.
